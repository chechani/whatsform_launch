        text: `WhatsForm was born out of a simple frustration: managing business on WhatsApp was chaotic. Information was scattered, follow-ups were missed, and scaling was impossible. We started by building a tool to create Google Form-like experiences inside WhatsApp, and quickly realized the potential was much bigger. Today, WhatsForm has evolved into a comprehensive conversational platform, powered by AI and robust automation, serving thousands of businesses worldwide.`,
