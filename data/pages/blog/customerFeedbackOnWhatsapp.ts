To get genuine, timely insights, you need to meet your customers where they are and make it incredibly easy for them to respond. That's why collecting feedback on WhatsApp is a game-changer.`

            text: `Instead of sending a link to a long, intimidating web form, WhatsForm allows you to create a conversational survey. The questions are delivered one by one in a chat, making the process feel interactive and less like a chore. This simple change in format can increase response rates by up to 3-4x compared to email.`

            text: `The best time to ask for feedback is right after a key interaction. With WhatsForm, you can trigger an automated feedback request immediately after a support ticket is closed, a product is delivered, or a service is completed. This ensures the experience is fresh in the customer's mind, leading to more accurate and valuable insights.`

By allowing for multimedia responses, you can gather richer, more detailed feedback that a traditional text-only survey could never capture.`

            text: `Collecting feedback is only the first step. Because WhatsForm is an integrated platform, a negative review can automatically create a high-priority ticket in your Team Inbox for immediate follow-up. This allows you to turn a poor experience into an opportunity to recover the customer relationship. By making feedback easy to give and easy to act on, you create a powerful loop for continuous improvement.`
