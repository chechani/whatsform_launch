Traditional methods like phone calls and emails are often inefficient and create administrative bottlenecks. By leveraging WhatsApp, healthcare providers can create a more responsive, efficient, and patient-centric communication system.`

            text: `Phone-based appointment booking is time-consuming for staff and often frustrating for patients. A WhatsForm bot can handle this entire process conversationally, 24/7. It can check doctor availability, book a slot, and send an instant confirmation. Crucially, it can also send automated reminders before the appointment, drastically reducing costly no-shows.`

They can fill in their medical history and securely upload insurance documents before they even arrive, saving time and ensuring data is accurately captured in the EMR system.`

A secure, automated workflow can deliver reports as a PDF directly to the patient's WhatsApp as soon as they are ready, along with clear instructions on the next steps.`

Automated WhatsApp drip campaigns can send medication reminders, check in on the patient's recovery, and provide links to physiotherapy exercises. This proactive follow-up improves patient adherence to treatment plans and helps catch potential complications early.`
