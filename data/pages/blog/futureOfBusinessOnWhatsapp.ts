Businesses adopted it organically, but their usage has largely been limited to simple, one-on-one chats or basic broadcasts. This is a massive underutilization of the platform. The true potential—the future of business on WhatsApp—lies in transforming it from a simple messaging app into a comprehensive platform for structured, automated workflows.`

Important information gets lost in long threads, follow-ups are forgotten, and there is no way to track, measure, or scale interactions. This is the "chaos tax" that businesses pay every day in lost productivity and missed opportunities.`

This is how a conversation can check inventory, calculate a quote, or update a customer record. Second, intelligent AI agents that can understand user intent, manage complex conversations, and make decisions, turning a rigid bot into a flexible, problem-solving assistant.`
