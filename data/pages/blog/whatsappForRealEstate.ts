By leveraging WhatsApp automation, real estate agents and developers can create a powerful funnel that captures, qualifies, and converts leads more effectively than ever before.'

A WhatsForm AI agent can engage them immediately. It can ask for their basic requirements (e.g., location, budget, number of bedrooms) and instantly provide them with matching listings from your portfolio, complete with photos and brochures.'

            text: "Once a prospect expresses interest in a property, the bot's job is to secure the next step: a site visit. Instead of a frustrating back-and-forth over the phone, the AI agent can show the prospect available time slots, let them book a visit directly in the chat, and send an automated confirmation with the property location and agent details. This seamless process dramatically increases the number of qualified site visits."

The bot can be configured to send automated follow-up messages, such as a reminder the day before a site visit or a thank you message afterwards with a feedback form. It can also nurture long-term leads by sending them updates on new property launches that match their criteria, keeping your brand top-of-mind.'

This frees up agents to focus on what they do best—building relationships and closing deals during site visits—while the technology handles the repetitive, time-sensitive work of lead qualification and scheduling.'
