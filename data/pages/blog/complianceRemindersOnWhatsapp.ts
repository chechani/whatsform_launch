However, the manual process of tracking dates and sending reminders via email is time-consuming and often ineffective. This is where automated WhatsApp reminders become an indispensable tool for modern practices.`

This allows you to send highly relevant, personalized reminders. A corporate client receives a reminder about ROC filings, while an individual receives one for their ITR due date. This targeted approach is far more effective than generic email blasts.`
