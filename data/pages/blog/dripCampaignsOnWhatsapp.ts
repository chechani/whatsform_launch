They might receive a welcome message immediately, a product feature highlight a day later, a customer testimonial after three days, and a special offer at the end of the week. This ensures your brand stays top-of-mind while the lead is still warm."

Based on a user\'s initial inquiry or their responses to interactive messages, you can enroll them in different, more relevant sequences. A lead interested in "Enterprise Solutions" gets a different set of messages than one interested in "Small Business Plans." This level of personalization at scale is impossible to achieve with manual follow-ups.'
