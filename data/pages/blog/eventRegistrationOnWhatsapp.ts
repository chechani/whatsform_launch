Traditional methods that rely on sending users to a web page create friction and can lead to lower sign-up rates. By moving the entire registration process into WhatsApp, you can create a seamless experience that boosts attendance.`

            text: `With WhatsForm, you can create a conversational registration form that users can complete without ever leaving WhatsApp. A user can simply send a keyword like "REGISTER" to your number to start the process. The bot then asks for their name, email, and any other required information one step at a time. This conversational approach feels more personal and is much faster than filling out a traditional web form.`

This can include a summary of their details and even a dynamically generated e-ticket with a QR code, delivered as a PDF directly in the chat. This provides an instant, professional experience that gives attendees all the information they need in one place.`

You can send a message a day before the event and another an hour before it starts, complete with a link to join the webinar or a map to the venue. These high-visibility reminders on WhatsApp are far more effective than emails and can significantly boost attendance.`
